# data-engineer-test
This is for prospective data engineers interviewing at Holman.

# Directions:
1. Fork this repo to your personal Github account, or simply pull down the files needed your your exercise.
2. Complete the below data exercises in the best way you see fit. Here are some potential implementation options:

- Develop within a PySpark Project: https://github.com/AlexIoannides/pyspark-example-project 
- Use a Jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/ or https://colab.google/ 
- Implement a local database: 
    - https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database
    - https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mysql/setting-up-a-local-mysql-database 

## Olympics
Build a pipeline that turns multiple .csv files into a singular data object.
1. Reference the data within `./datasets/olympics`. 
2. Combine all files in this directory into a single consummable artifact, such as a database table, a parquet file, or a .csv file. Dataframes are appreciated, but the final object must be query-able in a programmatic fashion. 
3. The above task should produce code that includes a schema defintion, transformation logic, and data upserts.

## Countries
Build a pipeline that turns a single .csv files into a singular data object.
1. Reference the data within `./datasets/countries`. 
2. Using the `countries of the world.csv`, create a database table, a parquet file, or a .csv file. Dataframes are appreciated, but the final object must be query-able in a programmatic fashion.
3. The above task should produce code that includes a schema defintion, transformation logic, and data upserts.

## Combing Olympics and Countries
Transform one or both of the olympics/countries tables to facilitate a join across these tables. 

1. Normalize the data by applying a foreign key(s) to one/both tables. The key should be unique to represent 1 country, and ensure no cartesian joins occur. (We are aware that no true key exists, and an artificial key(s) will need to be produced)
2. Transform the 2 data objects via denormalization, and deliver 1 consummable artifact in the form of a table, parquet, or something query-able.
